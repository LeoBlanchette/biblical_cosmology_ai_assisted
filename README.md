# Biblical Cosmology: An AI-Assisted Exploration

Welcome to the **Biblical Cosmology** project! This repository is dedicated to exploring the intricate celestial movements and geographic descriptions as outlined in ancient scriptures, particularly the **Book of Enoch**. Our goal is to bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and contemporary understanding, offering a holistic view of the universe grounded in scriptural truth.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into three main sections:

1. **Paths of the Luminaries**
   - Detailed analysis of the sun and moon's movements.
   - Alignment with biblical texts and symbolic meanings.

2. **The Winds**
   - Exploration of the wind portals and their significance.
   - Impact on weather, climate, and biblical symbolism.

3. **Geography**
   - Mapping ancient geographic descriptions.
   - Correlation with modern topography and spiritual insights.
