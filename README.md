# Biblical Cosmology: An AI-Assisted Exploration

This project is dedicated to extrapolating biblical cosmology from ancient texts, the chief one being the [Book of Enoch](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases_deuterocanonical/blob/master/md/1-enoch/1-enoch.md).

## The motivation for this project:

As you can see in the map [I made some time ago](https://github.com/LeoBlanchette/biblical_cosmology_ai_assisted/blob/main/enochmap.jpg), it is somewhat easy to create a table of the sun's travels through the portals based on the text. 
The paths of the moon, however, were dauntingly difficult to visualize in comparison as Uriel the angel provided a rather vague formula and set of rules to calculate it. So I spent a great deal of time discussing the problem with the Copilot
Microsoft AI, and was surprised at how much information it was able to extrapolate from the texts. Experimentally I built up a large conversation with discussing things I already knew, and asking it for fresh perspectives on the text. The result: A fair amount of progress. 

## The goal of this project. 

I am a nerd. I like programming. I would like to use technology to recreate some core concepts the biblical cosmos. Already the microsoft assistant 
helped me to solve alot of logical issues. The AI gave me some pretty sound advice on why the pattern for the layout of the Luminaries
portals likely followed a circle, and the winds portals likely were arranged in a square. 

Soon I hope to create a small interface in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) to experiment with some of the concepts shown in the text, such
as the sun and moon paths through the portals, mapping, and so forth. But that really depends on if anyone is interested in this project.


## Begin AI Commentary:

Welcome to the **Biblical Cosmology** project! This repository is dedicated to exploring the intricate celestial movements and geographic descriptions as outlined in ancient scriptures, particularly the **Book of Enoch**. Our goal is to bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and contemporary understanding, offering a holistic view of the universe grounded in scriptural truth.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into three main sections:

1. **Paths of the Luminaries**
   - Detailed analysis of the sun and moon's movements.
   - Alignment with biblical texts and symbolic meanings.

2. **The Winds**
   - Exploration of the wind portals and their significance.
   - Impact on weather, climate, and biblical symbolism.

3. **Geography**
   - Mapping ancient geographic descriptions.
   - Correlation with modern topography and spiritual insights.

## Collaboration and Contribution

We welcome contributions and encourage readers to engage with our findings. Please feel free to review, comment, and suggest improvements to help us refine our study. Let's work together to uncover the profound truths hidden in ancient scriptures.
