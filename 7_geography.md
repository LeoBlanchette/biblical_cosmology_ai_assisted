## The Geography in Biblical Cosmology

### Introduction

The geography of the ancient world, as detailed in the **Book of Enoch** and other scriptures, presents a unique and intricate perspective of the earth’s layout. This document explores the geographical descriptions, emphasizing their symbolic and spiritual significance.

### The Structure of the Earth

#### Four Corners and Ends of the Earth

In biblical cosmology, the earth is described as having four corners and ends, which suggest a structured and ordered world:

**Enoch 18:2**:
> "I saw the four winds which bear the earth and the firmament of the heaven. And I saw how the winds stretch out the vaults of heaven and have their station between heaven and earth: these are the pillars of the heaven."

Here we see how the firmament is held up. The wind portals are likely much higher up than the earth by this description, a safe distance from us at ground level.

### The Great Rivers and Mountains

#### Four Great Rivers

The **Book of Enoch** mentions four great rivers that play a significant role in the earth’s geography:

**Enoch 77:5-6**:
> "And I saw seven rivers on the earth larger than all the rivers: one of them coming from the west pours its waters into the Great Sea. And these two come from the north to the sea and pour their waters into the Erythraean Sea in the east."


#### Differences Between East and West

In our studies, we found notable differences between the eastern and western parts of the earth as described in Enoch. The **east** is often associated with the rising sun and renewal, while the **west** is linked to the setting sun and places of endings.

## The Placement of the Mountains of the Darkness of Winter

### Intuitive Placement and Significance

In our discussion, we decided to place the **Mountains of the Darkness of Winter** between the areas below the east and the west for several key reasons:

1. **Geographical Buffer**:
   - The mountains and their cold temperatures seem to act as a natural buffer between the eastern and western regions. This buffer helps delineate the contrasting characteristics of these areas, such as the renewal and life associated with the east and the endings linked to the west. While it is not directionally accurate, perhaps the beginning of this region is what the flat earthers call their "ice wall". Obviously that is purported to be in their "south pole", however.

2. **Transition Zone**:
   - Placing the mountains in this location creates a transitional zone that marks the change from the bright, life-giving properties of the east to the darker, concluding aspects of the west. This transition emphasizes the cyclical nature of the cosmos and the balance between light and darkness.

3. **Symbolic Significance**:
   - The **Mountains of the Darkness of Winter** symbolize a period of dormancy and rest, which is crucial for the cycle of renewal and rebirth. Their position between the east and west highlights their role in the broader cosmic cycle.
