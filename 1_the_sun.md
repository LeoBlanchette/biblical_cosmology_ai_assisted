## Article 1: The Luminaries

### The Path of the Sun

Biblical cosmology presents a distinct perspective compared to mainstream heliocentric cosmology and the popular flat-earth cosmology. In the **Book of Enoch**, the sun utilizes portals in its rising and setting, which is quite different from modern scientific explanations.

### Sun's Utilization of Portals

The **Book of Enoch** describes the sun rising and setting through specific portals. This concept is echoed in **Psalms 19:4-5**: "In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race." This verse hints at the sun emerging from a chamber, aligning with the idea of portals.

### Verses Indicating Sun's Portal-Traveling Pattern

- **Enoch 72:4-5**: Describes the sun rising in specific portals.
- **Enoch 72:9-10**: Details the sun’s journey through these portals.
- **Enoch 72:15-16**: Specifies the sun's setting through portals.

[In the map that the Enoch text presents](https://github.com/LeoBlanchette/biblical_cosmology_ai_assisted/blob/main/enochmap.jpg), east is up, which is different than traditional maps where north is up. This places south at the right and north at the left. 

The portals follow a circular pattern, with the first portal in the south and the last in the north. This arrangement emphasizes the ordered and cyclical nature of the sun's journey.

This table outlines the sun’s path, including its portal entries and the balance of day and night parts.

Next, we will analyze the patterns observed in the sun’s path.
