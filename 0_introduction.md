## Article 1: The Luminaries

### Introduction

The quest to understand the moon's movement has baffled scientists for centuries. Even Isaac Newton, with his work on gravity and celestial mechanics, struggled to create a definitive model for the moonâ€™s path. This challenge persists today, as the moon's orbit remains difficult to predict over long periods due to its complex interactions with other celestial bodies.

This struggle underscores a profound truth found in the scriptures, particularly in **2 Esdras**: 

> "For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea to his floods: even so they that dwell upon the earth may understand nothing but that which is upon the earth: and he that dwelleth above the heavens may only understand the things that are above the height of the heavens."

The **Book of Enoch**, a cornerstone of biblical cosmology, provides a detailed account of the heavens. Angels, under the direction of God, revealed these celestial mysteries to Enoch, offering insights that transcend human understanding.

In this article, we will attempt record the paths of the sun and moon as described by Uriel, the holy angel who guided Enoch. We will then analyze these paths for patterns.

Throughout this study, we adhere strictly to the principles of truth and the inspired texts. By doing so, we aim to bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and contemporary understanding, offering a holistic view of the cosmos grounded in divine revelation.

We will delve deeper into the celestial mechanics that have fascinated and inspired humanity for millennia.
