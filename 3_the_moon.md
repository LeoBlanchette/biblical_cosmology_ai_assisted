### The Complex Cycle of the Moon

#### The Law Stated by Uriel

The moon's cycle, as described by Uriel to Enoch, is intricate and detailed. This law highlights the moon's unique path and phases, emphasizing the divine order behind its movement.

**Scripture Reference:**

**Enoch 74:5-9**:

> "In two months the moon sets with the sun: in those two middle portals the third and the fourth. She goes forth for seven days, and turns about and returns again through the portal where the sun rises, and accomplishes all her light: and she recedes from the sun, and in eight days enters the sixth portal from which the sun goes forth. And when the sun goes forth from the fourth portal she goes forth seven days, until she goes forth from the fifth and turns back again in seven days into the fourth portal and accomplishes all her light: and she recedes and enters into the first portal in eight days. And she returns again in seven days into the fourth portal from which the sun goes forth. Thus I saw their position--how the moons rose and the sun set in those days."

This passage from the Book of Enoch details the moon’s cycles and alignments with the sun, highlighting specific portals and periods of movement. These descriptions form the foundation for our understanding of the moon's intricate path.

In addition to these monthly movements, the moon has a multi-year cycle. According to **Enoch 74:10-17**, the moon falls behind the sun and stars by 30 days every five years, amounting to a total of 80 days in eight years. This extended cycle further emphasizes the intricate and divine orchestration behind the moon’s journey.

This table outlines the moon’s path, including its portal entries, days of travel, light phases, and specific notes on its journey. By following this table, we can observe the complex and divine order behind the moon’s movement.

Next, we will analyze the patterns observed in the moon’s path and their symbolic meanings.
