### The Patterns of the Sun

#### Main Patterns of the Sun's Movement

The sun's movement, as described in the **Book of Enoch**, follows a cyclical and ordered pattern through specific portals. These movements are structured and consistent, reflecting an intricate celestial design.

- **Monthly Portal Travel**: The sun rises and sets through six eastern and six western portals, repeating its journey annually.
- **Day and Night Parts**: The balance of day and night parts varies monthly, reflecting seasonal changes and cosmic harmony.
- **The Great Portal**: Notably, the fourth portal is referred to as the "Great Portal," highlighting its significance in the sun's cycle. This portal marks key transitions in the sun's journey, such as the change of seasons and solstices. Its position in the center of the sequence indicates its pivotal role in maintaining cosmic balance and order.

#### Scriptural Connections

The sun's patterns are not only detailed in the **Book of Enoch** but are also echoed in other scriptures:

- **Psalms 19:4-5**: "In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race." This verse hints at the sun emerging from a chamber, aligning with the concept of portals.
- **Ecclesiastes 1:5-6**: "The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits." This passage reflects the cyclical and perpetual nature of the sun’s journey and supports the idea portrayed in Enoch that the sun is carried by winds through its cycle.
- **Enoch 72:37**: Describes how the west contains fiery areas that receive every setting of the sun, indicating that the sun has a power source. This contrasts with common heliocentric and geocentric models which often depict the sun as an isolated body in space. The fiery regions in Enoch emphasize the sun’s connection to a source of power and its divine maintenance. It could also be where the sun releases the remainder of it's power before recharging before or at the portals in the east. 

#### The Role of the Sun in Biblical Cosmology

The sun plays a crucial role in biblical cosmology, symbolizing various spiritual and cosmic truths:

- **A Source of Light and Life**: The sun is a symbol of righteousness, illumination, and divine presence. Its consistent journey ensures the balance of day and night, reflecting God's order and control over the cosmos.
- **Marker of Time**: The sun's path through the portals marks the passage of time, seasons, and years, serving as a celestial clock.
- **Symbol of Faithfulness**: The sun’s unwavering course through its portals is a testament to divine faithfulness and the unchanging nature of God's laws.

These patterns and connections highlight the sun's profound significance in biblical cosmology, offering a perspective that transcends modern scientific explanations.
